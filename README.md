__protoReaction is a NodeJS application for generating fully-configured React application projects, 
which can build to either React or Preact, from a single source tree.__

__Transpilation, bundling, loaders (file loaders, CSS and SASS loaders, et al.) are fully-configured, out-of-the-box.__

__Aside from requiring zero configuration, projects generated from protoReaction include fully-configured test libraries (MochaJS, nyc, chai, enzyme, sinon, et al.), 
as well as Redux, Redux Saga middleware, and REST utilities.__

__Redux Stores, Reducers, Redux Saga middleware, and action factory utilities are already created, combined, and ready for use, out-of-the-box.__

__Development tools for React, Preact, and Redux are also included, and loaded, when a project is run in development mode.__

__Projects generated are built, tested, and run, using simple scripts.__

## About

protoReaction is a project generation tool, which creates a project, which can then transpile and bundle to either React or Preact, from a single source code tree.

protoReaction generates a fully-equipped project, made to scale, with the following (but not limited to) libraries:  
Core:
* Babel
* Webpack
* React
* Preact
* SASS
* Axios
* Immer
* Immerable Record
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Day.js

Server
* Hapi

Test:
* Mocha + Mochawesome + Mochawesome Report Generator
* Enzyme
* Chai
* Sinon
* JSDOM
* NYC
* Karma + Karma Webpack (known issue, after the latest ModeJS minor update - working on it!)

Development:
* Webpack Dev Middleware (configured with Hapi)
* Webpack Hot Middleware (configured with Hapi)
* React Devtools
* Preact Devtools
* Redux Devtools

protoReaction projects come complete, with file loaders for fonts, stylesheets, audio, video, and image files.  
Projects are built, tested, and run, using simple scripts.

## Quickstart

#### Requirements
As of the latest update to this README, this project uses the following versions, of NodeJS, npm, and pnpm:

NodeJS: v14.17.1  
npm: v6.14.13  
pnpm: v6.9.1

Projects generated by protoReaction use pnpm, to manage workspaces (React and Preact), as well as perform tasks.  
To get started, install both pnpm and protoReaction, globally:
```shell
$ npm install -g pnpm@6.9.1 protoreaction@1.0.5
```

After successful installation of pnpm and protoReaction, you're ready, to create your first project.  
Projects are created in your current working directory.

The following command will create the project `myapp`, with version `1.0.0`, in your current directory:
```shell
$ protoreaction create myapp 1.0.0
```

Enter the project directory, install dependencies, and start the React in-memory development instance:
```shell
$ cd myapp
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run start
```

In your web browser, navigate to:  
[http://localhost:3001/mmry/index.html](http://localhost:3001/mmry/index.html)

To view all assets being served by Hapi (JSON endpoint):  
[http://localhost:3001/available](http://localhost:3001/available)

If the in-memory build and server start were successful, you should see the following test page:

## Beyond Quickstart

#### Additional `create` CLI Args (name = value pairs, i.e., `--ARG=[VALUE]`):
* `--NAME=[NAME]`: (Overrides unnamed arg) Name of your project (REQUIRED) (will be used in auto-configuration of package.json.
* `--VERSION=[SEMVER]`: (Overrides unnamed arg) Version (semver) of your project (will be used in auto-configuration of package.json.
* `--AUTHOR_NAME=[AUTHOR NAME]`: Name of your project author (will be used in auto-configuration of package.json.
* `--AUTHOR_EMAIL=[AUTHOR EMAIL]`: Email address of your project author (will be used in auto-configuration of package.json.
* `--AUTHOR_URL=[AUTHOR URL]`: Website URL of your project author (will be used in auto-configuration of package.json.
* `--HOMEPAGE=[PROJECT HOMEPAGE]`: Website URL for your project (will be used in auto-configuration of package.json.

```shell
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

To start with a React production + devtools in-memory build:
```shell
$ pnpm run start:prod-dev
```

To start with a Preact development in-memory build:
```shell
$ pnpm run start:preact
```

To start with a Preact production in-memory build:
```shell
